# crypto-clustering

## Description
This repository contains one python jupyter notebook titled `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb` in which the `crypto_market_data.csv` file is read. Preprocessing of this dataset is performed so the data is scaled as necessary for use in a model attempting to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. The scikit-learn library is used for analysis and plots are created from pandas DataFrames using hvplot.
